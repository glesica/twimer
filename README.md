# Twimer

A very simple stopwatch intended to be used with OBS or similar to display the duration of a stream.

## Wishlist

  * Ability to automatically update the stream title at some regular interval (such as an hour)
  * Ability to monitor stream events, specifically new subs, and adjust the time accordingly
    (increase the target, for example)
